# NOTE: about ember
Templates - 
    describe UI
    can contain plain HTMl
    can contain expressions: {{title}} (value comes from a component or controller)
    can contain helpers: {{#if isAdmin}}30 people have viewed your blog today.{{/if}}
    can contain components: a template listing blog posts rendering a component for each post
    
Components - 
    primary way UIs are organized
    contains a template and a js file that describes the components behavior
    
Controllers - 
    will be replacing Components
    
Models - 
    represent persistent state
    persists information to a server (or to localStorage)
    
Routes - 
    load a controller and a template
    load models to provide data to the controller that can be displayed by the template
    
The Router - 
    maps a URL to a route
    
    
!!! The URL drives the state of the application. 
    The URL determines which route to load, 
        which determines what model, controller, and template to load.
